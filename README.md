## Summary

I am a creative computing student with advanced coding skills in Python, HTML, C++, JavaScript, and I'm familiar with p5.js, Tone.js, and openFrameworks. I specialize in generative art and have experience creating sketches that explore various techniques, including autonomous agents, fractals, phase sketches, and particle systems. I also have a fundamental understanding of application development, UX/UI design, web development, and graphics design. Currently in my second year at university, I am actively seeking internship opportunities for the upcoming summer.
